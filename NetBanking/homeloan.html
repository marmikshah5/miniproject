								<td style="text:bold">When To Apply For Home Loans</td>
								<td>
									One can apply anytime after deciding to acquire or construct a property,
									 even if the property has not been selected or the construction has not commenced. 
									The loan amounts are sanctioned in principle to let buyers know what amounts they are eligible of. 
									<br /> disbursements start after satisfactory validation of all necessary documents and 
									completion of specific procedures.
								</td>
							</tr>
							
							<tr>
								<td>Eligibility</td>
								<td>
									While determining the loan eligibility of a customer, 
									lending institutions primarily focus on the repayment capacity. <br />
									The repayment capacity is determined by taking into consideration factors 
									such as income, age, qualifications, number of dependants, 
									spouse's income, assets, liabilities, stability and continuity of occupation and savings history.

									<br>b) Prepayment Penalties: When a loan is paid back before the end of the agreed duration a penalty is charged by some banks/companies,
									 which is usually between 1% and 2% of the amount being pre paid.
