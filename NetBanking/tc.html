<br>
I shall not hold the Bank responsible for not processing/effecting any transactions in case the Bank does not receive instruction to this effect even though I have forwarded the same electronically, i.e. by means of e-mails and short messaging services (SMS). In the event of any dispute on the actual communication made to the Bank , the records of the Bank shall be final and binding on me . 
<br>
I hereby agree to abide by the following Terms and Conditions in addition to the Terms and Conditions as applicable to NetBanking: 
<br>
I shall be at liberty to utilise the Payment Instruction Services through NetBanking for transfer of funds for such purpose, as I shall deem fit; 
<br>
I have the full right and/or authority to access and avail of the services obtained and the goods purchased and I shall observe and comply with the applicable laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in applicable territories. I shall not involve the Bank as a party to such transaction. I shall provide the Bank with such information and/or assistance as is required by the Bank for the performance of the Services and/or any other obligations of the Bank herein. 
<br>
I shall not at any time provide to any person, with any of my details held by me with the Bank, including Customer ID, IPIN, account number, Card details, PIN/TIM m-PIN which may be assigned to me by the Bank from time to time.
<br>
I agree that the Bank shall be entitled to presume that all instructions received by the Bank by using my Cust id and IPIN are in order / genuine and have been actually given by me and I shall be bound by the same conclusively.
<br>19	Risks:
I hereby acknowledge that I am availing the Payment Instruction Services at my own risk.
<br>20	Misuse of Cust id and IPIN: 
I acknowledge that if any third person obtains access to my Cust id and IPIN, such third person would be able to provide Payment Instructions / other instructions to the Bank. I shall ensure that the Terms and Conditions applicable to the use of the Cust id and IPIN as contained herein are complied with at all times. 
<br>
Internet Frauds:
<br>The Internet per se is susceptible to a number of frauds, misuse, hacking and other actions that could affect Payment Instructions / other instructions to the Bank. Whilst the Bank shall aim to provide security to prevent the same, there cannot be any guarantee from such Internet frauds, hacking and other actions that could affect Payment Instructions / other instructions to the Bank including result in delay or failure in processing the instructions. I shall separately evolve/ evaluate all risks arising out of the same and the Bank shall not be responsible for the same. 
<br>I understand that doing a NetBanking transaction at a Cybercafe/shared computer terminal is risky and I shall not use the services of a cybercafe/shared computer terminal to do any NetBanking transactions. 
<br>
Mistakes and Errors: 
<br>The filling in of applicable data for transfer of funds and/or issue of Demand Drafts would require proper, accurate and complete details. 
<br>
For instance, I am aware that: 
<br>
<br>I would be required to fill in the correct account number of the person to whom the funds are to be transferred; 
<br>I would be required to fill in the correct Credit Card number while making Credit Card payments; 
<br>I would be required to fill in the correct details such as the name of the payee (who may or may not have an account with the Bank), mailing address, amount of the Demand Draft and the city/state where the Demand Draft is payable. 
<br>
In the event of any inaccuracy in this regard, the funds could be transferred to incorrect accounts or the Demand Draft maybe incorrectly issued or sent to a wrong address and there is no guarantee of recovery of the same thereafter. I shall therefore take all care to ensure that there are no mistakes and errors and that the information given by me to the Bank in this regard is error free, accurate, proper and complete at all points of time. I indemnify the Bank from any loss due to an error on my part. 
<br>
On the other hand in the event of my account receiving an incorrect credit by reason of a mistake committed by some other person, the Bank shall be entitled to reverse the incorrect credit at any time whatsoever without my consent. I shall be liable and responsible to the Bank and accede to accept the Bank's instructions without questions for any unfair or unjust gain obtained by me as a result of the same. 
<br>
Transactions: 
<br>The transactions, which may require, the transfer of the funds or issue of Demand Draft may not fructify or may not be completed by the parties to whom I request the Bank to transfer the funds or issue of Demand Draft. The Bank is not in any manner involved in the said transactions and contracts and my sole recourse in this regard shall be with the party with whom I have the transactions. The Bank is merely providing me services whereby the said funds would be transferred on my instructions. 
<br>
Technology Risks: 
<br>The technology for enabling the transfer of funds and the other services offered by the Bank could be affected by virus or other malicious, destructive or corrupting code, programme or macro. It may also be possible that the site of the Bank may require maintenance and during such time it may not be possible to process the request of the customers. This could result in delays in the processing of instructions or failure in the processing of instructions. I understand that the Bank disclaims all and any liability, whether direct or indirect, whether arising out of loss or profit or otherwise arising out of any failure or inability by the Bank to honour any customer instruction for whatsoever reason.
